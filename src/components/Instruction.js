          <h2>What is this?</h2>
          <p>
            Have you ever encountered free party or meetup and realised that half the people registered did not actually turn up?
            BlockParty solves this problem by providing a simple incentive for people to register only if they mean it.
          </p>
          <h2>How does this work?</h2>
          <p>
            Simple. You pay small deposit when you register. You lose your deposit if you do not turn up. You will get your deposit back + we split the deposit of whom did not turn up.
            You go to party and may end up getting more money.
          </p>

          <h2>Targetted users</h2>
          <p>
            The current users are mostly participants of Blockchain related events, such as conference pre/post dinner, meetups, and hackathons. The users are expected to own some Ether (a virtual currency, shorten for ETH), to pay the deposit of the event, as well as usage fee of its platform called [Ethereum](http://ethereum.org).
          </p>

          <h2>How to setup</h2>

          <h3>Option 1: access from mobile browser</h3>
          <p>This is the recommended way. The easier step by step guide is <a href='https://medium.com/@makoto_inoue/participating-blockparty-event-with-a-mobile-wallet-b6b9123246f7' >here</a></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Step 1: Download <a href='http://status.im'>Status.im</a>,  <a href='https://www.cipherbrowser.com'>Cipher Browser</a> or <a href='https://trustwalletapp.com'>Trust Wallet</a> from App store/Google play</li>
            <li>Step 2: Create an account on your wallet, and make sure you have some Ether.</li>
            <li>Step 3: Type the event url on their built in browser </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Option 2: access from desktop browser with <a href='https://metamask.io/'>Metamask</a> Chrome extension</h3>
          <p>This is the most popular way right now.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Step 1: Install <a href='https://metamask.io/'>Metamask</a> Chrome extension </li>
            <li>Step 2: Create an account on your metamask, and make sure you have some Ether.</li>
            <li>Step 3: Refresh the page </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Option 3: access from normal browser connecting to local node</h3>
          <p>This has been the standard way to access Dapp prior to Ethereum Wallet (lower than v 0.7)</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Step 1: Install <a href='https://github.com/ethereum/mist/releases'>Mist browser (v 0.8 or higher)</a>, and make sure you choose <em style={{fontWeight:'bold'}}>mainnet</em>. Here is <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3JfLgjqNU4'>a quick video tutorial</a> </li>
            <li>Step 2: Create an account on your wallet, and make sure you have some Ether.</li>
            <li>Step 3: Stop Ethereum Wallet</li>
            <li>Step 4: Start geth(Go Etheruem, command line tool) with the following options. (See the <a href='https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Building-Ethereum'>installation instructions</a> for each platform)</li>
            <li>Step 5: Refresh this page </li>
          </ul>
          <blockquote style={{backgroundColor:'black', color:'white', padding:'1em'}}>
            geth --unlock 0 --rpc  --rpcapi "eth,net,web3" --rpccorsdomain URL
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            NOTE: <span style={{backgroundColor:'black', color:'white', padding:'0.3em'}} > --unlock 0</span> will unlock with one account. <span style={{backgroundColor:'black', color:'white', padding:'0.3em'}} > --unlock 0 1</span> will unlock with two accounts.
          </p>

          <h2>How to play?</h2>
          <p>
            Type your twitter account, pick one of your address, then press 'RSVP'. It will take 10 to 30 seconds to get verified and you will receive notification.
            Once registered, join the party! Your party host (the contract owner) will mark you as attend.
            Once the host clicks `payout`, then you are entitled to `withdraw` your payout.
          </p>

          <h2>FAQ</h2>
          <h3>Can I cancel my registration?</h3>
          <p>No</p>
          <h3>What happens if I do not withdraw my payout?</h3>
          <p>
            If you do not withdraw your payout within one week after the event is end, the host (contract owner) will clear the balance from the contract and the remaining blance goes back to the host, so do not keep them hanging
          </p>
          <h3>What happens if the event is canceled?</h3>
          <p>
            In case the event is canceled, all registered people can withdraw their deposit.
            Make sure that you register with correct twitter account so that the host can notify you.
          </p>
          <h3>What if there is a bug in the contract!</h3>
          <p>
            If the bug is found before the contract is compromised, the host can kill the contract and all the deposit goes back to the host so he/she can manually return the deposit.
            If the contract is compromised and the deposit is stolen, or his/her private key is lost/stolen, I am afraid that the host cannot compensate for you. Please assess the risk before you participate the event.
          </p>

          <h3>Can I host my own event using BlockParty?</h3>
